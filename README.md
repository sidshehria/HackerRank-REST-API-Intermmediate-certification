## Description
This repository contains solutions to the problems from the HackerRank REST API Intermediate Certification exam. The solutions involve querying REST APIs to solve tasks related to football matches. The scripts include:

1. Total_Goals_by_a_Team.py
Description: This script calculates the total number of goals scored by a given team in a specified year.
Functionality: The program makes GET requests to REST endpoints to collect the number of goals scored in matches where the team is playing as either the home or away team. The data is aggregated to give the final total.

3. Number_Of_Drawn-matches.py
Description: This script calculates the number of drawn matches in a specified year.
Functionality: Similar to the previous problem, this program queries a REST API for matches in a specific year and counts the number of matches that ended in a draw.
